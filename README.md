# GridGame
 
 A game using a grid with pieces on it that deal damage to each other.

Something fun to do after work. Written in the WPF GUI framework. Probably will implement a Rock, Paper, Scissors element for some dynamic play. 
Inspired from an old CN flash game about Gundam that I remember playing a long time ago.

# GridGame
 
 A game using a grid with pieces on it that deal damage to each other.

 THIS IS FOR LEARNING PURPOSES. I'm throwing stuff at it to see what sticks so it will be messy until I've settled on some concrete OOP design.

Something fun to do after work. Written in the WPF GUI framework. Probably will implement a Rock, Paper, Scissors element for some dynamic play. 
Inspired from an old CN flash game about Gundam that I remember playing a long time ago.
